# How it works.
* Discord has added a feature named ["Gateway Intents"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway), which are a form of real-time communication over secure WebSockets. This is to control abuse of data and to lower computational overload.

# WARNING !
* Discord will only allow you to MASS DM once and then your bot will be flagged for spam and you will recieve the following error: `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: DiscordAPIError: Your bot has been flagged by our anti-spam system for abusive behavior. Please reach out to our team by going to https://dis.gd/report and selecting "Appeal an Action Trust and Safety took on my bot" as the Report Type.`
* Your discord bot will be quarantined stopping you from Mass Messaging users in a guild.
* Previous testing suggests any guild over 100 members, results in your bot quarantined.

### Example

## How to Resolve:
* Make a new Discord bot.
* Go call for an [appeal](https://dis.gd/report) and selecting "Appeal an Action Trust and Safety took on my bot" as the Report Type for your bot so the bot is removed from being flagged. (Must Think of a good reason as to why you want bot to be unflagged)

*First option recommended*
