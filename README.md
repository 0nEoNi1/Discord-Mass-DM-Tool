# 7TEEN-MASS-DM-BOT
Simple Mass DM bot

# How To set up
install npm (npm init) and install discord (npm i discord.js) for your node modules and package.json and package-lock.json

Put your bot token in config.json and set the prefix and the owner ID of the bot

# DISCLAIMER
Discord's API changed, making this mass dm tool very unreliable.

This is what you might see:
- It DM's everyone in the server
- It DM's half or less than half users
- It Only DMs you and 3-5 bots or users

Make sure if you're going to mass dm, to do it in a channel where everyone can see it. it limits the number of users it can dm
